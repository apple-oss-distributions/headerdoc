The filtermacros.pl script is an experimental piece of code intended to
allow you to selectively filter out chunks of headers based on C preprocessor
directives such as #if and #ifdef.  Because it is still experimental, it is
not installed as part of the Mac OS X installation, and is only available if
you download the headerdoc source code tarball.  If you find this tool useful,
please test it and file bugs as needed.

This tool can only filter one file at a time.  The first filename specified
is the input filename, and the second (optional) filename is the output
filename.  If no output filename is specified, standard output is used.

In order for this tool to do its job, you must specify a list of macro
definitions that you care about using the -D and -U flags (or --defined
and --undefined).

This filter errs on the side of inclusion of all content unless it matches
the specified definitions.  For example:

	#if (!(defined(MY_MACRO) && defined (MY_OTHER_MARCRO)))
		IF STUFF
	#endif

The "IF STUFF" is only excluded if BOTH the MY_MACRO and MY_OTHER_MACRO
definitions are specified on the command line.  Similarly:

	#if (FOO > 3 || BAR < 2)
		IF STUFF
	#else
		ELSE STUFF
	#endif

Both the "IF STUFF" and "ELSE STUFF" portions above are included unless
the filter code knows definitions for BOTH the FOO and BAR variables so
that it can evaluate which portion to include.
